# Statistical Models

This repo contains two little projects:
- a set of exercises solved while attending classes taught by prof. Giovanni Marchetti ([folder][course])<br>
  for a graduate course at the University of Florence;
- a study of the paper *Decomposition by clique separator* by Robert Tarjan ([folder][tarjan])<br>
  for a PhD course taught by prof. Marchetti again.

Both of them are TeX documents and can be compiled under a POSIX system using `make` as usual.
