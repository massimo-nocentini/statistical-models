# Statistical Models

This repo contains the following little projects:
- a set of exercises solved while attending classes taught by prof. Giovanni Marchetti ([folder][course])<br>
  for a graduate course at the University of Florence;
- a study of the paper **Decomposition by clique separator** by Robert Tarjan ([folder][tarjan])<br>
  for a PhD course taught by prof. Marchetti again;
- a study of the paper **Evolutionary Stochastic Search** by Bottolo and Richardson ([folder][bottolo])<br>
  for a PhD course taught by prof. Francesco Stingo.

Both of them are TeX documents and can be compiled under a POSIX system using
`make` as usual (it requires a TeX distribution).
