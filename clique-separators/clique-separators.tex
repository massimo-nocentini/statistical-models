\subject{
This talk has an educational purpose to understand concepts explored in the
paper "Decomposition by clique separators" by Robert E. Tarjan; moreover, we
use it to pass a PhD course taught by prof. Giovanni Marchetti @ University of
Florence.  Tarjan considers the problem of decomposing a graph by means of clique
separators, by which he means finding cliques (complete graphs) whose removal
disconnects the graph.

% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.


\begin{frame}{intro}

\begin{block}{we aim to}
\begin{itemize}
    \item study the paper \textit{Decomposition by clique
    separators}\\{\footnotesize by Robert E. Tarjan, Discrete Mathematics, Volume 55,
    Issue 2, July 1985}
    \item understand the fundamental idea of \textit{vertex elimination order}
    \item provide a prototype implemented in Python 
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{the big picture}
Tarjan considers the problem of decomposing a graph by means of \textbf{clique
separators}, by which he means finding \textit{cliques (complete graphs) whose removal
disconnects the graph.} 
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{defs}
$G = (V, E)$ denotes a \textit{connected, undirected} graph where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ is a set of vertices $\lbrace v_{0}, \ldots, v_{n-1} \rbrace$
    \item $E$ is a set of edges $\lbrace e_{0}, \ldots, e_{m-1} \rbrace$ \\
    such that $e_{i}= \lbrace u, v \rbrace$ for some $u, v\in V$
\end{itemize}
\vfill
$G(X)=\left(X,  \lbrace \lbrace u, v \rbrace \in E: u, v\in X \rbrace\right)$ 
\begin{itemize}
    \item provided that $G=(V, E)$ and $X\subseteq V$
    \item $G(X)$ is the subgraph of $G$ induced by vertex set $X$
\end{itemize}
\vfill
$G(V\setminus X)$ is disconnected $\rightarrow$ $X$ is a \textit{separator} for $G$
\vfill
$C= \lbrace c_{0}, \ldots, c_{h} \rbrace\subseteq V$ is a \textit{clique}
$\leftrightarrow$ $\lbrace c_{i}, c_{j} \rbrace \in E$ for all $c_{i}\neq c_{j}\in C$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{defs}
A cycle $\alpha = (v_{0}, v_{1}, \ldots, v_{k-1}, v_{0})$ of length $k$ has a
\textit{chord} if $\lbrace v_{i},v_{i+j} \rbrace\in E$ where $j>1$
\vfill
A graph $G$ is \textit{chordal} if every cycle $\alpha$ of length $k\geq 4$ has
a chord
\vfill
a bijection $\pi: V \rightarrow  \lbrace 0, \ldots, n-1 \rbrace$  is an
\textit{elimination ordering} for $G$
\vfill
let $F_{\pi} = \left\lbrace \lbrace u, v \rbrace \not\in E:
        \begin{array}{l}
            (u, w_{0}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, v) \text{ is a path in } G\\ 
            \text{such that } \pi(w_{j})< \min{ \lbrace \pi(u), \pi(v) \rbrace}\\
            \text{where } j\in  \lbrace 0, \ldots, k-1 \rbrace \wedge u\neq v
        \end{array}
        \right\rbrace$ in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $F_{\pi}$ is a \textit{fill-in edge set} for $\pi$
    \item $G_{\pi}=(V, E\cup F_{\pi})$ is a \textit{fill-in graph} for $\pi$ 
    \item $\pi$ is \textit{perfect} if $F_{\pi}=\emptyset$
    \item $\pi$ is \textit{minimal} if no ordering $\rho$ exists such that
    $F_{\rho}\subset F_{\pi}$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{approach}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{divide and conquer}: decompose $G$ into a hierarchy of
    components; then, solve the problem in each component at the bottom;
    finally, piece together solutions all the way up for the whole $G$
    \item decompositions exists already, \textit{respect to the size} of the
    separator set $X$.  On the contrary, Tarjan studies \textit{respect to the
    structure}, namely $X$ has to be a \textit{clique}
    \item assume $G=(V, E)$ has a clique separator $C$, therefore $ \lbrace A,
    B, C \rbrace$ partitions $V$. So, $G$ decomposes to $G_{AC}=G(A\cup C)$ and
    $G_{BC}=G(B\cup C)$. Since they are both graphs, then recurs on both $G_{AC}$
    and $G_{BC}$ till no further decomposition is possible
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{thms}
\begin{theorem}
$\pi$ elimination ordering for $G$ is perfect $\leftrightarrow$ $G$ is chordal
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
let $\pi$ elimination ordering for $G$ be minimal in: 
\begin{center}
$C$ is a clique separator for $G$ $\rightarrow$ $CC_{G(V\setminus C)}(u) =
CC_{G(V\setminus C)}(v)$
\end{center}

for all $ \lbrace u, v \rbrace \in F_{\pi}$ and $CC_{G}(w)= \lbrace z\in V:
    (w,\ldots,z) \text{\small\,is a path in } G \rbrace$
\end{theorem}

\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

  % Keep the summary *very short*.
  \begin{block}{Key points}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item split $F(t)$ in $F^{[\mathfrak{p}]}(x,y)$ to account for bits $1$ and $0$
      \item ${{R}^{[\mathfrak{p}]}}$ and ${{R}^{[\bar{\mathfrak{p}]}}}$ are both RA
      $\leftrightarrow$  $\mathfrak{p}$ is a Riordan pattern.
      \item requiring $|w|_{0}\leq|w|_{1}$ entails
          \begin{displaymath}
          \begin{split}
          S^{[\mathfrak{p}]}(t)&=R^{[\mathfrak{p}]}(t,1)\rightarrow 
            [t^{n}]S^{[\mathfrak{p}]}(t)= \left|\left\lbrace w \in  \mathcal{L}^{[\mathfrak{p}]}:
                \begin{array}{l} |w|_{1} = n \\ |w|_{0}\leq|w|_{1} \end{array}\right\rbrace\right|\\
          L^{[\mathfrak{p}]}(t)&=R^{[\mathfrak{p}]}\left(t^2,\frac{1}{t}\right)\rightarrow
            [t^{n}]L^{[\mathfrak{p}]}(t)= \left|\left\lbrace w \in  \mathcal{L}^{[\mathfrak{p}]}:
                \begin{array}{l} |w| = n \\ |w|_{0}\leq|w|_{1} \end{array}\right\rbrace\right|\\
